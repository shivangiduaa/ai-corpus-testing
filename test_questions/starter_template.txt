Tips for Writing Good Test Questions
For Known Answer Tests:
✓ Ask for specific facts (prices, features, specifications)
✓ Questions should have clear, definitive answers in your corpus
✓ Avoid ambiguous phrasing
✗ Don't ask questions that require interpretation
✗ Don't ask questions with multiple valid answers
For Unknown Answer Tests:
✓ Ask about information you deliberately didn't include
✓ Test internal company data (revenue, customer counts)
✓ Test policies you haven't documented yet
✗ Don't ask about information that's tangentially related
✗ Don't ask questions the AI might reasonably infer
For Edge Case Tests:
✓ Ask philosophical or judgment-based questions
✓ Test whether AI matches your brand voice
✓ Include emotional or frustrated user scenarios
✗ Don't expect perfect answers—you're testing tone and approach
✗ Don't write trick questions designed to trap the AI
